# Multiplayer-maze-runner-game
Developed a local Multiplayer Maze Runner Game using Python 3 and the Pygame library. The project uniquely simulates Operating System concepts, including Round Robin Scheduling for player turns and using mutual exclusion logic to prevent conflicts when both players land on the same tile. The architecture follows a modular design with separate files for the main controller, player objects, and maze environment, analogous to an OS kernel and process management. Key functionalities include random maze generation, real-time keyboard interrupt handling for dual players, collision detection (acting as memory protection), and a scoring system tracked via SQLite. This demonstrated expertise in full-cycle game logic development, real-time input/output management, and the practical application of advanced computer science concepts. All core functionalities, including movement synchronization, wall collision, and win conditions, have passed testing and validation
